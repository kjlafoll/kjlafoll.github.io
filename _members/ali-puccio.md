I’m Ali Puccio, a sophomore studying Computer Science with minors in Psychology and Childhood Studies. I have always been interested in child and educational psychology through my work with children but never understood the potential for these interests to intersect with my enjoyment of computer science. Through learning about computational modeling and how it can be used to understand psychological processes, affective computing has become a new area of interest for me that I’m excited to explore through research. Outside of academics, I enjoy getting involved in the campus and Cleveland communities through intramural sports and Girls Who Code — a club that introduces high school girls and other underrepresented gender identities to computer science concepts.
