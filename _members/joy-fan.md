My name is Joy Fan and I am a sophomore / junior (upcoming year) majoring in Computer Science and Psychology and minoring in Artificial Intelligence, Applied Data Science, and Chinese. With my knowledge of computer science and psychology, I hope to use my computer science knowledge to destigmatize mental health and understand human behavior. From a research perspective, I am most interested in studying how to model mood disorders or trauma and its effect on human behavior and thought patterns. Additionally, I am also passionate about studying populations from diverse backgrounds and how models change in regards to having different cultural backgrounds. Outside of research, I enjoy helping my community and am the co-president of CWRU Girls Who Code, where we teach high school females and other underrepresented gender minorities how to code. In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano and violin.
