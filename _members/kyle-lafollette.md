I am a third year PhD candidate in psychology at Case Western Reserve University, working primarily with Professor Heath Demaree (CWRU, Psychological Sciences), Professor Brooke Macnamara (CWRU, Psychological Sciences), and Professor Amit Goldenberg (Harvard University, Harvard Business School). My research focuses on cognitive mechanisms underlying social and emotional decision-making, particularly where negative emotions that are percieved or experienced. I primarily use computational cognitive modeling to explore these mechanisms. Affective computing represents a nascent area in cognitive science. The significance of emotion on daily events, from decisions big to small, is undeniable and in many cases adaptive. Yet, our knowledge of the cognitive processes that that give rise to those decisions largely neglect the role of affective mechanisms. My work aims to elucidate those mechanisms, by investigating how negative emotions, such as anxiety, anger, and sadness, influence individuals and collectives through the lens of affective computing.
