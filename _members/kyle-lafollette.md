I am a PhD candidate in Psychology at Case Western Reserve University, working primarily with Professors Heath Demaree, Brooke Macnamara, and Amit Goldenberg. My research focuses on cognitive mechanisms underlying social and emotional decision-making, particularly where emotions are perceived or experienced. I primarily use computational cognitive modeling and affective computing methods to explore these mechanisms. In addition to this primary line of research, I also have interests in developing new computational methods for psychological science, such as equation discovery algorithms for reinforcement learning models and simulation routines for diffusion models with analytically intractable likelihood functions. Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained a B.Sc. in Cognitive Science and Biopsychology from the University of Michigan and conducted post-bac research at the University of Arizona and Stanford University.
