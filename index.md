# The Emotion, Cognition & Computation Mini-Lab

In this mini-lab, we explore the interaction between affective and cognitive processes through computational modeling. We use reinforcement learning, sequential sampling, signal detection and Bayesian inference models to elucidate mechanisms for learning, and decision-making. We incorporate insights from behavioral experimentation and psychophysiology.

Our research focuses on cognitive mechanisms underlying social and emotional decision-making, particularly where negative emotions such as anxiety, anger, and sadness are percieved or experienced.
