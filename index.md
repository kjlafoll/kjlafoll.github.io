# The Emotion, Cognition & Computation Mini-Lab

The Emotion, Cognition, & Computation (ECCO) Mini-Lab, directed by Kyle LaFollette, studies affective and social cognition as complex dynamical systems. We use computational models of reinforcement learning, sequential sampling, and Bayesian inference to elucidate mechanisms for affective decision-making and social cognition, in addition to developing new computational modeling methods. We incorporate insights from behavioral experimentation and psychophysiology.

Our research program focuses on developing computational models to better understand the complex, dynamic systems underlying human behavior, decision-making, and emotions.
