By saying that the tanks are in the mountains, he deliberately provides false information, hoping to deceive the captors and mislead them away from the actual location of the tanks, which is by the sea. The prisoner's intention is to safeguard his army's position and prevent the Red army from discovering the true whereabouts of the tanks.",2,"Brian says this in an attempt to convince the person serving the food to give him four sausages instead of the allowed two, by claiming that he won't be having any dinner when he gets home.",1,"Mrs. Smith said that to stress the need for finding homes for the kittens.

Human,18,"Short answer: Because Simon is a liar - or at least that is what we know from what is written about him above. So, it is likely his brother Jim won't believe Simon's response to his query regarding where he (Simon) has hidden the paddle, and Jim will therefore look in the place where Simon inferred he did not hide the paddle.
 
 Long answer: Jim believes his brother Simon has stolen his ping-pong paddle and has hidden it either under his (Simon's) bed or in the cupboard. Jim demands to know where Simon has hidden the paddle. But Jim is very precise in the way he words his demand to his brother and provides Simon with only one of two possible answers to choose from - either 'under the bed' or 'in the cupboard'. Perhaps Jim was using a kind of process-of-elimination strategy on Simon - by keeping his question quite precise and limited (in terms of possible hiding places) - because Jim is well aware that his brother is a big liar. Simon tells Jim he hid the paddle under the bed, but because Simon tells lies, Jim is likely to suspect his brother's response will be a lie also. Therefore, Jim will look in the cupboard first. :)",2,"Because the Red Army will not believe he is telling the truth.

 She could have been making a sarcastic, dark joke; we don't know if Jill and Mrs Smith know each other well, or anything about their history. We do know that Jill knows a woman nearby has kittens she want to give away, so they could be close neighbours or even friends.
 Or perhaps Mrs Smith is trying to make Jill feel guilty, manipulating her into getting one of the male kittens. If they don't know each other well, Jill might feel pressured to take one.",2,"I think Peter didn't want to make his aunt feel bad about her hat.

It migh've been clear from her delivery that even though she said she liked it, she in face didn't like it and the parrents may have picked on that. Or she could have said in in a believable way making the family think she liked the gift.
 
 Depending on how she said it, it could show she really wanted to let the family know she didn't like it without saying it explicitly, OR she really didn't want them to know she was disappointed. The reason she didn't want them to know could be not wanting to hurt their feelings or she might be worried about their reaction.",2,"I think that considering what we know about her, the reaction was understandable; all the things she fears seem to be about to happen.

There was no way for her to know if there was any ill intent from the man so she thinks offering her purse will result in her not being harmed.",2,"We don't know anything about how experienced this burglar is, his age, build, etc. This leads me to think he was scared of any physical confrontaton. He may also have felt that the officer knew he was a burglar and that ultimately there was no way to escape.

She may have heard that this is a good tactic to use, but of course, depending on the country she's in, this interview question may or may not be something the new employer could check. If not, there's no harm in telling a lie, but if they can check, then it could look bad for her (meaning she's taking a risk).",2,I think Mary must've told her friend about her mother's personality.

Even though she was truly disappointed that she didn't receive the rabbit she had wanted, she chose to hide her feelings to maintain a happy and positive atmosphere on Christmas Day.
